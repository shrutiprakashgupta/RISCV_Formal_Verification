# Combined Verification - Memory Stage  
The testbench used is the same as that for individual memory stage. All of the assumptions except those related the instruction and data memory data values are kept - as these as quite large modules, thus it is not a good idea to keep the RTL in the test environment. 

# Errors/Bugs Detected
No bugs detected in this case.
